# Tram Countdown

Checks when your tram leaves from Trappentreustr. and switches as many lights on as there are minutes left.

For e.g. Line 18 to Effnerplatz, run:

```
./tram-countdown 18 Effnerplatz
```

This runs with your Mac's system Ruby but you need to install the `mvg-live` gem:

```
sudo /usr/bin/gem install mvg-live
```
