# Tram Countdown

Checks when your tram leaves from Trappentreustr. and switches as many lights on as there are minutes left.

For e.g. Line 18 to Effnerplatz, run:

```
./tram-countdown 18 Effnerplatz
```

This requires Ruby 2.0. Also you need to bundle the dependencies first:

```
bundle install
```
